# Animal Trading Cards Project for Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree

This is my submission for the Animal Trading Card Project of which the purpose is to create 
a basic webpage resembling a trading card. I chose my dog Opal who of course if my favorite animal. 
The requirements include provind an image that is no wider than 300 pixels of which I futher resized
to reduce loading time. The project is visisble on [github](https://github.com/tbsharkey/animal-trading-card).
