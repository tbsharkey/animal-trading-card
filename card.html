			<p id="summary">Opal is a 90 pound Rottweiler that splits her time with family between Oregon and Washington state.
				 She was born of an accidental litter between an American and a German Rottweiler.<br>
				When not hanging out on her favorite couch she is either chewing on bones or digging holes in the backyard.
				 She enjoys all people and will walk up expecting to be petted whether her intended target is willing to or not.
